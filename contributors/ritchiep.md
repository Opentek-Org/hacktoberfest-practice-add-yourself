Hello everyone, my name is Ritchie, 20 years old from Malaysia. Currently a second-year undergraduate student at the University of Science Malaysia.

I'm still not a mobile app developer, but I use Python and a bit of Google technologies to develop a chatbot on Discord.

I discovered open source when I started getting into coding. Fascinated by how well everybody is able to work together and contribute towards one project.
